# Parts

Here are the things you will need to purchase in order to build the bot the same way that is described in this repo. 
The table here will all be amazon (none affiliate) links however feel free to source the parts from wherever you want.
Going to assume you have all the side things need (Soldering Iron, Flux, Printer Filament, Wires,Etc) 

Note: The amount specifies how many of a single component you need. Ex. the Ultrasonic sensors ship in packs of 5. We only need 2 of those 5 for the build.

If you are looking for the 3d Printed Parts just navigate to the 3d-prints folder.

## The Damage
