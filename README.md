# Micro Hal - Spot Micro bot Variation

This take on the spot-micro attempts to pull pieces together from various different spot projects into one complete package.

The goal of this project is to not only pull the best pieces from the various spot projects but also to have a single repo that contains everything you need to get up and running smoothly.

Each project that pieces are taken from will be documented in this README so anyone who is interested can visit the parent projects.

All current code samples, models, and rewrites used for this project will be posted within this repo.

This is a ROS-Noetic implementation



This project is a combination of various other projects with changes that are made to each of them in order to get it working.
These changes have been documented in the [changes.md](changes.md) file.
